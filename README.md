I have created a work day planner with save function.

In index.html you will find the basic layout along with links to bootstrap and fontawesome that was used for icons.

In style.css you will find all the styling for the page. All the way from the header to the footer and everything in between.

The script.js contains all the functionality components to make the planner work. From the updated date on the header, to the different color that pops up
when the time is now in the past.

Also gives you the ability to save your events into local storage.
